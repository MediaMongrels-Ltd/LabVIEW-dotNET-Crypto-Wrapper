# LabVIEW .NET Cryptography Wrapper
A LabVIEW wrapper for the .NET Cryptography library.

Supporting:
- Asymmetric Encryption: RSA
- Hash Functions: MD5, HMAC (256/384/512), SHA-1, SHA-2 (256/384512)
- Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generation (RNG)
- Symmetric Encryption: AES
- Key Derivation: PBKDF2
- Cryptographic Key Management using Software/Hardware based keystores (e.g. TPM2.0)

For more information about the .NET implementation of these functions, see:
